        <p>&ldquo;Nathan's professionalism, ingenuity, and work ethic make him a dream collaborator. Our creation of an online game was a brand new experience for me and my company. Nathan was able to not only deliver a product that was user friendly and great fun, but provided clear options, consistent and friendly communication, and researched everything for informed decision making. We would work with Nathan again in a heart beat and count ourselves lucky to have had his expertise on board.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Nathan worked for me at Rush University Medical Center in the McCormick Educational Technology Center. We made numerous improvements to systems and processes over the 18 months I was there. Many of these improvements would not have gone so smoothly if it had not been for Nathan. He is very proactive in identifying potential problems and improvements. He does his own research and discovers potential solutions and then makes his suggestions. I always appreciated his willingness to be a strong member of our team.&rdquo;</p>
