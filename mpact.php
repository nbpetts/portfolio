          <h2>The Problem:</h2>
          <p>How do you convey a technology that doesn’t yet exist in a way that a potential client understands it? My partner and I conceived and prototyped an app that takes advantage of The Internet of Things.</p>

          <h2>It Started with the Technology</h2>
          <p>Mpact is a small Bluetooth beacon that retailers can use to offer customers engaging information that will aid their shopping experience. My partner Majel has experience working with the backend technologies that drive Mpact and we wondered how the consumer app might look. We brainstormed ideas for the product as I interviewed him about Mpact.</p>

          <h2>Then We Sketched</h2>
          <p>Majel sketched out the screen sequence for an item search by keyword. I sketched a flow we had discussed where the app finds the first item on a user’s shopping list and then directs the user around the store to complete their list. The sketching was invaluable in our collaboration. It was specifically helpful in conveying to Majel what the map navigation would look like. Also, the sketches became our to-do list as we moved into Axure to make the prototype more realistic. </p>

          <h2>Prototyping</h2>
          <p>Because we had such a clear roadmap from our sketches, it was obvious how to divide the work. I took the first few screens of the map and Majel added some of his screens. As the designs came together we were able to spot inconsistencies quickly. Finally, we worked together to test it and give notes on sections we had each designed.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working to our strengths works best.</strong> One of the reasons that our team was successful was that we complemented each other. Majel had experience with the Mpact system and I had design and Axure knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Find the right tools to collaborate.</strong> Using many iterations and visual materials helped us to communicate.</li>
          <li><strong>Prototyping shows where to look next.</strong> Each time we created an iteration, we took notes about where we could improve. Each new iteration was better than its predecessor.</li>
