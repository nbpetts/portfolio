          <h2>The Problem:</h2>
          <p>How do you design an information architecture that offers bank users access to all of the functions available at the branch or ATM? Furthermore, how do you design with a bias toward users who seldom use the system?</p>

          <p>These sketches demonstrate the evolution of thought and design for this project. Sketching helps me gather my thoughts and visualize how the app design should come together.</p>

          <h2>Iterations</h2>
          <p>While the first design depicted below incorporates all of the required functions, it doesn’t flow and causes the user to scroll back and forth to reference settings between accounts. Also there is a lot of repetition and unnecessary table borders. This adds to the cluttered feel of the app.</p>

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sketching helps to identify and detail user requirements.</strong> The process of sketching an interface requires the designer to think through and ask about all of the required options. It also provides a ready to-do list when coding the app. </li>
            <li><strong>The layout can make or break a design.</strong> A user should be able to view information easily and understand how to use the app almost immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Keeping options and functions visible and simple helps improve learnability.</strong> </li>
