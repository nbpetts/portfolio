                    <p>Now a resident of Portland OR, for ten years I was a Chicago actor and improvisor. Computers and technology have always fascinated me. Iâ€™ve figured out a way to do what I am passionate about while earning a living.</p>
                    <p>I am a lifelong learner and have a history of teaching myself skills, from JavaScript frameworks to pneumatic blood squibs. Need a backpacking stove made from a Pepsi can? I got you covered.</p>
