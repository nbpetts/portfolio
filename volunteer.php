          <h2>Finding the Right Volunteer Opportunity is Hard</h2>
          <p>Volunteers can be difficult to wrangle and there is some evidence that people willing to volunteer are on the decline. My group decided to explore the question: Can the ways people search for volunteer opportunities give us design insights for technologies that connect people with volunteer opportunities? To answer this question, we approached our research from three angles: observations, interviews and a survey.</p>

          <h2>Observations </h2>
          <p>We conducted observations of users searching for volunteer opportunities to see how they go about it. To analyze the data, we transferred our observations to the affinity diagramming tool Stormboard. We then sifted the data and created an affinity diagram to help us discover patterns that would aid in answering our research questions. </p>

          <h2>Interviews</h2>
          <p>We used the themes in our affinity diagram to guide the development of an interview script. Next we ran a pilot of the interview on other UX researchers to test the clarity of our questions. We interviewed four users who were frequent volunteers. We then transcribed the interviews and coded the transcription. From there we identified themes that the volunteers talked about. </p>

          <h2>Survey </h2>
          <p>We used the data from the observations and interviews to generate two hypotheses to test. We hypothesized that users who find activities aligned with their interests will commit to volunteering more frequently than users who locate opportunities that do not align with their interests. We further hypothesized that when searching for volunteer opportunities online, the amount of detail presented about the opportunity has a direct impact on a person’s likelihood of volunteering. We compiled our survey and pilot tested it before distributing it more broadly. Thirty-nine people completed the survey and we ran statistical tests on the results. We did not find any statistically significant results and concluded that our survey did not address our hypotheses well, so we relied more heavily on the qualitative data from our interviews and observations to write our recommendations.</p>

          <h2>Our Recommendations</h2>
          <p>There are several themes in our data that we think will help organizations use technology to more effectively recruit volunteers. For example, in our exploratory research, we encountered few sites that listed the skills a volunteer might learn. Volunteers are interested in much more detail about what the volunteer role entails and easy scheduling is important as well. We compiled our recommendations and ranked their priority.</p>

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Observations show what people do, interviews reveal how people feel.</strong> It is clear that when one sets out to answer a research question, the right tool is required. Otherwise you risk wasting everyone’s time. Pilot studies and a firm understanding of the theory behind UX best practices can help!</li>
            <li><strong>Ethnographic research is worth the effort.</strong> It is invaluable for finding out how people feel, why they do things and what they really want. However, ethnographic research must be approached with the utmost rigor, so you don’t end up following false leads.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypotheses can be hard to substantiate.</strong> If you are going to go through the effort of doing quantitative research, you really need to make sure that your sample size is large enough to generate meaningful results.</li>
